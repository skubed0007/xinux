## 🚀 Key Features

### 1️⃣ **Customizable Prompt Styles**
- Why settle for boring prompts when you can have **15+ stunning styles**? Pick one that screams *you*—or at least whispers it politely.
    - **Examples:** 
        - Single-line (for minimalists)
        - Two-line (for overachievers)
        - Boxed (because why not?)
        - Minimal (less is more)
        - Classic (nostalgia, anyone?)
        - Bold Frame (for the dramatic)
        - Cyberpunk (neon dreams)
        - Retro (hello, 80s!)
- Oh, and did we mention they’re **colorized** and adapt to your current directory? Your terminal will look so good, you might start showing it off at parties.

### 2️⃣ **Intelligent Auto-Completion**
- Typing is hard. Let Xinux Shell do the heavy lifting with **context-aware auto-completion** for:
    - Shell history (because who remembers what they typed 5 minutes ago?)
    - Built-in commands (like `cd`, `ls`, and other classics)
    - Executables in your `$PATH` (no more guessing games)
    - User-defined aliases (your shortcuts, your rules)
- And if you mess up? Don’t worry—**hints for incomplete commands** will gently nudge you in the right direction. It’s like having a helpful friend who doesn’t judge.

---

### 3️⃣ **Advanced History Management**
- Forget the days of scrolling through endless, messy command history. Xinux Shell keeps things tidy:
    - **Duplicate-free history tracking** ensures no command gets repeated unnecessarily. (We’re looking at you, `ls`.)
    - Want a clean slate? Just type `clear history` and poof—gone.
- Your history is safely stored in:
  ```plaintext
  ~/.config/.Xinux/history.txt
  ```
- Never lose track of your most-used commands again. Unless you want to, of course.

---

### 4️⃣ **Powerful Aliases**
- Tired of typing the same long commands over and over? Create **custom shortcuts** with the `alias` command.
    - **Usage:**
      ```bash
      alias name=command
      ```
    - **Example:**
      ```bash
      alias ll="ls -la"
      ```
- Aliases are saved for eternity (or until you delete them) in the configuration file. Your fingers will thank you.
